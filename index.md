## Installation Process

To install my Arch Linux system, the [Arch Wiki Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) was used.

An Arch Linux .iso file was received via flash drive to load the .iso into VMWare Fusion. From here, the installation guide follows through the steps to setup a Linux system.

### Installing Arch Linux

First, the boot mode was verified to be UEFI with the command:
```markdown
ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
```
Successful running of this command verifies that the system is in UEFI mode.

Next, internet connection was checked with the commands:
```markdown
ip link
ping archlinux.org
```
The network interfaces are listed and packets were returned, confirming internet connection.
